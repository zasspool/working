# Dotfiles
**Currently a Work-In-Progress until I get symlinks and an installation script working.** <br>
Some things to remember and keep when getting dev environments up and running.

#### Terminal formatting
- Color Profile: HomeBrew
- Text Color: White
- Text Size: 14 pt
- [Shell tab] When the shell exits: close the window
- [Advanced tab] Uncheck "Allow VT100 application keypad mode" to allow numpad in Vim.

#### TODO
